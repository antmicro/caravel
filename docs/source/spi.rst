    All configuration bits other than the prescaler default to value zero.

.. _reg_spi_data:

``reg_spi_data``
----------------

Base address: ``0x24000004``

.. wavedrom::

     { "reg": [
         {"name": "SPI data", "bits": 8},
         {"name": "(undefined, reads zero)", "type": 1, "bits": 24}]
     }

The byte at ``0x24000004`` holds the SPI data (either read or write).

Reading to and writing from the SPI master is simply a matter of setting the required values in the configuration register, and writing values to or reading from ``reg_spi_data``.
The protocol is similar to the UART.

A write operation will stall the CPU if an incomplete SPI transmission is still in progress.

Reading from the SPI will also stall the CPU if an incomplete SPI transmission is still in progress.
There is no FIFO buffer for data.
Therefore SPI reads and writes are relatively expensive operations that tie up the CPU, but will not lose or overwrite data.

.. note::

    There is no FIFO associated with the SPI master.
